# Frequency Analyser

After watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY) of 3Blue1Brown about the visualisation of the Fourier Transform, I wanted to play with it. And so I made this small simulation tool, allowing you to create signals, change their frequency, their amplitude and their waveform.

When you add a track, you will get this. You can configure the signal with the inputs present on the left side.

This track is not modifiable. This is an accumulation of every track you have created and so you can see here multiple frequency spike on the bottom right graph.
